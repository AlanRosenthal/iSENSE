	<p>The Internet System for Networked Sensor Experimentation (iSENSE) is a collaborative initiative of the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UMass Lowell) and Machine Science Inc. The project is supported by a pair of three-year grants from the National Science Foundation's Advanced Learning Technologies program.</p><br/>
	<p>The iSENSE web system enables users to contribute data collected using classroom probes and other sensor hardware, view and analyze data from other contributors, and combine data from multiple sources to examine regional, national, and global phenomena. To facilitate the collection of meaningful data, UMass Lowell and Machine Science have prototyped a low-cost data-logging device—the Portable iSENSE Network Point, or PINPoint—which features a range of on-board sensors, a GPS receiver, and a connector for external sensors. By pooling their data on the web, users can, in essence, create an expanded sensor network, and engage in collaborative research on STEM topics ranging from human health to environmental science and energy conservation.</p><br/>
	<p>Electronic sensors and probes are common in high school classrooms and university science labs around the country, but students typically use these instruments in isolation, with a single probe attached to a single personal computer, generating a local and private pool of data. Moreover, classroom probes are often used in uninspired ways—for example, to measure a known physical property of matter or to confirm a law of motion. In contrast, the iSENSE system pools data from multiple sources, and empowers users to pose their own research questions.</p>
